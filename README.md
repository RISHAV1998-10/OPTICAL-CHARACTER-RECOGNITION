# OPTICAL-CHARACTER-RECOGNITION

OCR = Optical Character Recognition.
<br>OCR systems transform a two-dimensional image of text, that could contain machine printed or handwritten text from its image representation into machine-readable text. OCR as a process generally consists of several sub-processes to perform as accurately as possible
 In other words, OCR systems transform a two-dimensional image of text, that could contain machine printed or handwritten text from its image representation into machine-readable text. OCR as a process generally consists of several sub-processes to perform as accurately as possible. The subprocesses are:

    * Preprocessing of the Image
    * Text Localization
    * Character Segmentation
    * Character Recognition
    * Post Processing <br>
    
The sub-processes in the list above of course can differ, but these are roughly steps needed to approach automatic character recognition. In OCR software, itâ€™s main aim to identify and capture all the unique words using different languages from written text characters.


## OCR with Pytesseract and OpenCV<br>
**Pytesseract** : Pytesseract is a wrapper for Tesseract-OCR Engine. It is also useful as a stand-alone invocation script to tesseract, as it can read all image types supported by the Pillow and Leptonica imaging libraries, including jpeg, png, gif, bmp, tiff, and others.
<br>**OpenCV** : OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. This is an open source library that includes several hundreds of computer vision algorithms.

## Shortcomings of this project
* *The test in the image should be preferabbly in one column format.*
* *After edge detection using canny edge detector, the OCR often confuses betewwn different characters and special characters like C and ( etc.*
